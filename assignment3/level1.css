and the back of the card is dark coloured, it is matches fine with any colours basically, in my own opinion. Though the front of the card
is pink and redish colour, I tried adjusting the brightness of the background, and decide to have a lighter background, which is also
more colouful.  */

/* the button also uses this font but bold, with a playful pink background introducing to the next page as the next level's baground colour
 is adjusted from a red gradient. Also having a border radius of 25px, which creates a rounded edge, it's cute and creates a aesthetic for 
 kids game. after testing around and interacting with the site, I decided to also add a scale change after hovering, scale larger when hover
 on to the button, so user can visually see where they're hovering onto.  */
