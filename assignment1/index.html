      <li class="gap2" >What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</li>
      
        <h3 class="gap2">The first feature that caught my attention is the fly next to the mouse, which follows its movement in every direction of the mouse. </h3>
      <li>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</li>
        <ul>
          <li >I pressed the power button at the center of the shirt in the homepage. </li>
          <li>I clicked the menu icon, an animation of a hand pulled down a list, showing three different content options: Home, About, and Work.</li>
          <li>I assumed the page I was on was "Home," so I clicked on "About."</li>
          <li>The website displayed a hand holding a phone screen. I read the self-introduction and scrolled down, revealing lists of his skills, soft skills, transversal skills, and the awards he had received.</li>
          <li>I clicked the menu icon again and pressed "Work."</li>
          <li>Similar to the phone screen display, it showed a laptop screen. As I scrolled down, it displayed some of his works.</li>
          <li>The first one was a website called FRDU. Since it was clickable, I clicked on it, and it showed images of the FRDU website. There was a button to slide the photos to the right, showing four images in total of the FRDU website.</li>
          <li>I scrolled down, and the next one was images of the website "alannn." It also had four different images of the website.</li>
          <li>I scrolled down to the last one, which was a 3D portfolio of the "alannn" website. It only had two images. When I went back, I noticed the work was still in progress.</li>
          <li>Lastly, I pressed on his logo at the top left, and it took me back to the homepage.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</li>
        <h3>I spent the most time interacting with the "Work" section. It's very engaging that I can view each of his works through the laptop screen inside the website and experience them as if they were actual websites. Even though they were images, it created a sense of illusion.</h3>
      <li>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</li>
        <h3>My most common action during the two-minute interaction was scrolling, as most of the information on alannn's website needed to be viewed by scrolling down.</h3>
      <li>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</li>
        <h3>The primary goal of the interactive experience on alannn’s website is to provide information about himself to users, such as his skills, abilities, works, and the awards he has received, in an engaging way. This enables users to gain a better understanding of him. I think this was achieved through the interesting use of pictures within pictures.</h3>
      <li>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</li>
        <h3>The website uses simple colors and layouts to convey information, incorporating interactions such as clicking, swiping, scrolling, and exploration. Scrolling is mainly used to keep users engaged, while the use of PiP (Picture-in-Picture) enhances the user experience. This feature allows users to explore his website without switching between windows.</h3>
      <li>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</li>
        <h3>I think the ratio of interaction duration to interaction frequency is 3:5. The full duration of the experience should be around 10–15 minutes if each piece of content is read carefully. The frequency of interaction should be approximately 36–54 times.</h3>
      <li>How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</li>
        <h3>A longer interactive experience should generally correspond to a higher frequency of interaction; however, this depends on the layout and content. In this case, alannn’s website uses PiP (Picture-in-Picture) in its layout, which shortens the duration by eliminating the need to switch between windows, thereby reducing the number of interactions required. Additionally, the use of numerous visual cues further decreases the overall interaction time.</h3>
      <li>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</li>
        <h3>The core media forms referenced in this experience are websites, interactive media, and digital media.</h3>
      <li> What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</li>
        <h3>This interface is a website-based media form; therefore, interacting with a mouse is necessary. Since it also references interactive media, the most frequent interactive actions include clicking, scrolling, and swiping.</h3>
      <li> What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</li>
        <h3>A website is a more comfortable media form to interact with, as I am more familiar with websites compared to other media forms such as apps and software. Interactive media created a strong sense of connection while I was engaging with the website. Its features also sparked my curiosity and excitement as I explored the different functions.</h3>
      <li>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</li>
      <h3>The most frustrating part of the interaction was the last work presented in the "Work" section. It was noted as still in progress and only had two images, although it was listed as having four images, which I thought was an error or a bug in the interaction.</h3>
      <li>What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</li>
        <h3>The most satisfying part is the two PiP (Picture-in-Picture) features of the mobile screen and laptop screen. By scrolling, the inner screen slides up within the picture without affecting the outer picture. Not having to switch to a different window or tab makes the interaction smooth and satisfying.</h3>
